How many NFTs are considered "floor" NFTs in a collection?

I computed `sale_price / floor_at_sale` for BAYC:
38.32% of apes have sold within 5% of the floor before.

A collection's floor is currently way too dominant as a pricing reference, and this shouldn't be the case.

I wanted to confirm the myth that auctions’ bids are actually mostly at the start/end, so I visualized @nounsdao
 auctions’ bids

Even though it was kinda expected, I’m pretty surprised how much action takes place in the last 4 mins
